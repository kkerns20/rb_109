## QUESTION 1

### Example

#### Code

```ruby
a = 4
b = 2

loop do
  c = 3
  a = c
  break
end

puts a
puts b
```

#### Answer
The ouput of line 9 will the integer 3 due to its reassignment within the loop block, while `puts` always returns `nil`
The output of line 10 will be the integer 2 since it was initialized on line 2, while `puts` always returns `nil`

This is an example of variables as pointers and variable scope. `a` was initialized in the outer scope and will be accessible throughout the program, so when it is reassigned within the block passed to the method call for `loop`, `a` will now reference 3, breaking its link with the object it initially referenced
