## Variables

**Variables**
: storage containers for information as represented by Ruby objects (such as strings, integers, arrays, etc...)

Variables act as *pointers*, meaning they contain references to objects they point to in memory. Variables are assigned to objects using the assignment operator `=`.

## Scope

**Scope**
: the characteristic of a variable that defines where that variable can be accessed. It refers to the parts of the code which consider the variable to be "defined", meaning where the object that the variable references can be pulled up and manipulated.

```ruby
def different_scope
  puts message
end

message = "I am a defined variable pointing to a string object"

# below, the variable message is within the current scope, and can be accessed
puts message
# => "I am a defined variable pointing to a string object

# local variables cannot be accessed from within methods, which have their own independent scope
different_scope
# => NameError (undefined local variable or method `message' for main:Object)
```

The scope of any given variable is dened by _where the variable is initiailized_. Different scopes are defined by different kinds of code boundaries in Ruby

### Global vs Local Scope

Variables with **global scope** are defined outside of any method definitions and can be accessed from anywhere in the program. In Ruby, global scope is limited to **constants** and **global variables**. Note that constants can be accessed even if they are initialized in inner scope (but that isn't a good practice).

```ruby
MESSAGE = "I can be accessed anywhere"

def different_scope
  puts MESSAGE
end

puts MESSAGE    # => "I can be accessed anywhere"
different_scope # => "I can be accessed anywhere"
```

Variables with **local scope** are defined within a method or in the main function of the program, and they obey all scope boundaries, meaning that the object they reference can only be accessed if that particular variable is _in scope_. Otherwise, the program will throw a NameError and consider the variable undefined. IF you wish certain methods to have access to variables that are not in their scope, you will need to pass those variables as arguments.

```ruby
def different_scope(string)
  puts "This method accepts a local variable as an argument"
  puts string
end

message = "I am a local variable."

puts message  # => "I am a local variable."
puts different_scope(message)
# => "This method accepts a local variable as an argument."
# => "I am a local variable"
```

### Inner vs Outer Scope

In Ruby, inner and outer scope is defined by a **block**. A **block** is a piece of code surrouncded by either curly braces `{..}` or `do..end` that is passed to a method invocation as an argument.

Local variables defined in **outer scope** (i.e. outside the block) can be accessed from **inner scope** (i.e. inside the block); however, local variables defined in **inner scope** (inside the block) _cannot_ be accessed from **outer scope** (outside the block).

```ruby
x = "I am a local variable initialized in outer scope."

1.times do |n|  # method call with a block
  x = "So I can be accessed and re-assigned in inner scope."
  y = "I am a local variable initialized in inner scope."
end

puts x
# => "So I can be accessed and re-assigned in inner scope."
puts y
# => NameError (undefined local variable or method `y' for main:Object)
```

## Scopes with a Block

A **block** is usually defined by curly braces `{..}` or `do..end`, but not all code surrounded by `do..end` constitutes a block that creates a separate scope. *Only* blocks that are passed to a **method call** will create inner and outer scope.

```ruby
# block passed to a method call, creates separate scope
loop do
  a = "inner scope variable"
end

puts a # => NameError

# not a block, despite do...end, so no separate scope is created
i = 0
while i < 1 do
  b = "can be accessed in outer scope"
  i += 1
end

puts b # => "can be accessed in outer scope"
```

When a block _is_ passed to a method call, it creates an **inner scope** for local variables. A variable initialized within the block will have an inner scope, while a variable initialized outside of the block (within the main body of the program) will have outer scope.

Outer scope variables can be accessed from within inner scope, meaning that any outer scope variable defined outside of the block can be accessed, manipulated, changed, or re-assigned within the block ([Inner vs Outer Scope](#inner-vs-outer-scope)).

Inner scope variables cannot be accessed from outer scope. Trying to access the objects they reference outside the block will cause the program to throw a NameError ([Inner vs Outer Scope](#inner-vs-outer-scope)).

If you have two separate blocks (known as _peer blocks_), they will each define their own independent inner scopes. These scopes will not interact or interfere with each other in any way. Any variable initialized within the inner scope of one block will _not_ be accessible from the inner scope of the other block (nor the outer scope).

Should these block each contain a variable defined within inner scope, both of the same name, these would be separate variables that point to separate objects in memory.

```ruby
1.times do
  a = "local variable a"
  b = "local variable b"
  puts a.object_id
end

1.times do
  a = "local variable a"
  puts a.object_id
  puts b
end

# => 260
# => 280
# => NameError (`b` is out of scope)
# two separate variables initialized in two separate blocks result in
# two separate object id's, even though the objects are identical
```

Nested blocks create nested levels of inner and outer scope. The terminology in this case differs, instead of inner and outer, we say _first level_ score, _second level_ scope, _third level_ scope, and so on. First level scope will refer to the outermost scope of the program, and progress down from there. Variables initialized in teh first level scope will be accessible in all of the remaining inner scopes. Variables initialized in the second level scope will be accessible in higher lever inner scopes but not in the first level scope. Variables initialized in third level scope will be accessible from higher level inner scopes but not from the first or second level.

```ruby
a = "First level variable"

1.times do
  b = "Second level variable"

  1.times do
    c = "Third level variable"

    puts a                      # => "First level variable"
    puts b                      # => "Second level variable"
    puts c                      # => "Third level variable"
  end

  puts a                        # => "First level variable"
  puts b                        # => "Second level variable"
  puts c                        # => NameError (out of scope)
end

puts a                          # => "First level variable"
puts b                          # => NameError (out of scope)
puts c                          # => Name Error(out of scope)
```

### Variable Shadowing


**Variable shadowing**
: blocks inner scope from accessing specific local variable in the outer scope. It occurs when a block parameter takes the same name as an already initialized local variable in the outer scope. Variable shadowing causes the code within the block to reference the object the block parameter point to, rather than the object referenced by the local variable in outer scope with the same name; furthermore, it makes it so you cannot change or re-assign that outer scope local variable.

```ruby
a = "Local variable in outer scope"

%w(each element is passed to the parameter per iteration).each do |a|
  puts a
end

# => 'each'
# => 'element'
# => 'is' ... etc

b = "Local variable in outer scope"

%w(elements to assign to parameter).each do |b|
  b = "Let's try to assign a new value"
end

puts b
# => "Local variable in outer scope"
```

Always choose specific and descriptive variable names to avoid this issue.

## Scopes with Methods

A **method**'s scope is entirely independent and self contained. Any local variable accessed by a method must either be initialized within the method (in which case, that variable will not be accessible in the main scope of the program) or passed to the method as an argument

```ruby
a = "local variable in main function of program"

def method
  puts a
end

method    # => NameError (method cannot access 'a')

# pass in the variable as an argument

b = "local variable"

def method(variable_to_pass_in)
  puts variable_to_pass_in
end

method(b)   # => "local variable"
```

Local variables that are passed in to methods as arguments cannot be altered from within the method (unless those variables happen to reference collection objects, whose elements can be changed to achieve mutation).

```ruby
a = 'local variable'

def change_method(variable)
  variable = 'reassigned in the method'
end

change_method(a)     # => returns 'reassigned in the method'
puts a               # => 'local variable'
```

Blocks within a method invocation will create an outer and inner scope within the method. These follow the normal rules of scoping as they would in the main function of the program.

```ruby
def method_containing_block
  a = "Outer scope within the method"

  1.times do
    b = "Inner scope within the method"
    puts a      # => "Outer scope within the method"
    puts b      # => "Inner scope within the method"
  end

  puts a        # => "Outer scope within the method."
  puts b        # => NameError (`b` is out of scope here)
end

puts a          # => NameError (`a` cannot be accessed outside the method)
puts b          # => NameError (`b` cannot be accessed outside the method)
```
