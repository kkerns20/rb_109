## Collections

- Element Reference
- String Element Reference

```ruby
s = 'Hello World'
puts s[0]
puts s[2]
puts s[-1]
puts s[2, 3]
puts s[2, 3][2]
```

## Array Element Reference

```ruby
arr = %w(a b c d e f g)
arr[0]          
arr[1]          
arr [-1]        
arr[2, 3]      
arr[2, 3][2]
arr = %w(a b c d e f g)
arr.slice(3, 1)
arr.slice(3..3)
arr.slice(3)
```

## Hash Element Reference

```ruby
hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }
hash[:one]
hash[:two]

hsh = { 1 => 'one', 2 => 'two' }
hash[2][2]
```

## Out of Bounds Indices

```ruby
string = 'Hello'
string[5]
string[-6]
arr = ['one', :two, 3, nil]
arr[4]
arr[3]

arr.fetch(3)
arr.fetch(4)
```

## Invalid Hash Keys

```ruby
hsh = {one: 'son', two: 'shoe', infinity: nil }
hsh[:one]
hsh[:three]
hsh[:infinity]

hsh.fetch(:infinity)
hsh.fetch(:three)
```

## Comparison

- The Comparison Operator

```ruby
2 <=> 1
1 <=> 2
2 <=> 2

'b' <=> 'a'
'a' <=> 'b'
'a' <=> 'a'

1 <=> 'a'
```


## Sorting

### Sorting Strings

```ruby
'a' <=> 'b'
'apple' <=> 'ape'
'cat' <=> 'catty'

words = %w(card soap knife crab soapy coin sand king kill)
words.sort
```

### Sorting Arrays

```ruby
[[2, 4], [2, 1, 4], [0, 1, 2], [3, 2, 0], [0, 1], [3, 2, 5]].sort
```

## Shallow Copy

### Mutating an element in a collection copy

```ruby
arr_a = %w(ant bat cat)
arr_b = arr_a.dup

arr_b[1].upcase!
p arr_a
p arr_b
```

### Mutating a collection copy as a whole

```ruby
arr_a = %w(ant bat cat)
arr_b = arr_a.dup

arr_b.map! { |word| word.upcase }

p arr_a
p arr_b
```

### Mutating each element within a collection copy

```ruby
arr_a = %w(ant bat cat)
arr_b = arr_a.dup

arr_b.map! { |word| word.upcase! }

p arr_a
p arr_b
```

### Question 24

What does the following code output? What does it return? When is a good time to use the each method?

```ruby
names = ["george", "bobbi", "joel", "susan"]
names.each do |name|
  puts name.capitalize
end
```

### Question 25

What if we call the destructive capitalize! method here?
What does the following code output? What does it return? When is a good time to use the each method?

```ruby
names = ["george", "bobbi", "joel", "susan"]
names = names.each do |name|
          name.capitalize
        end
```
