## Local Variable Scope

### 1

**Current time:** 

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
a = “Hello”
b = a
a = “Goodbye”
puts a
puts b
```

The code above returns `nil` twice and outputs `"Goodbye"` and then `"Hello"`. This is example of how variables behave as pointers and are no deeply linked to each other, even when on is assigned to the other. It is also a demonstration of how reassignment creates a new object in memory that will break the binding between the variable and the object it previously referenced.

`a` is initialized and assigned the string object `"Hello"`. Then `b` is assigned to reference the same object as `a`, namely `"Hello"`. `a` is then reassigned to the string object `"Goodbye"`. This breaks the common reference between a and b. 

The puts method is called and will always return nil. Invoking the puts method and passing in the local variable `a` as an argument will output "Goodbye" and return nil. Then, Invoking the puts method and passing in the local variable `b` as its argument will output "Hello", as that is what is still referenced, and will return `nil`

### 2

**Current time:** 6:50 + revisions

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
a = 4

loop do
  a = 5
  b = 3
  break
end

puts a
puts b
```

on line 1, the local variable `a` is initialized and assigned the integer 4, remembering that integers are immutable.

the `loop` method is invoked on line 3 and passed a `do..end` block as its argument. This creates an inner loop. Because `a` was initialized in the outer loop, it will be accessible within the loop block, so it is reassigned to the integer 5 on line 4. `b` is initialized on line 5 and assigned to the integer 3. A `break` statement is then used to exit the loop, which does not make use of the `loop` capabilities.

The puts method is invoked, which will output the argument given to it and always return `nil`. Calling `puts` with the argument `a` will output the reassigned value of 5 and return `nil`. `puts` is then called again with `b`, and since `b` was initialized within the loop block, it is not in scope, resulting in a NameError`

This is an example of local variable scoping rules in relation to the inner and outer scope created when a block is passed to a method call as an argument.

### 3

**Current time:** 

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
a = 4
b = 2

loop do
  c = 3
  a = c
  break
end

puts a
puts b
```

The ouput of line 9 will the integer 3 due to its reassignment within the loop block, while `puts` always returns `nil`
The output of line 10 will be the integer 2 since it was initialized on line 2, while `puts` always returns `nil`

This is an example of variables as pointers and variable scope. `a` was initialized in the outer scope and will be accessible throughout the program, so when it is reassigned within the block passed to the method call for `loop`, `a` will now reference 3, breaking its link with the object it initially referenced

### 4

**Current time:** 8:30 --> in class

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
def example(str)
  i = 3
  loop do
    puts str
    i -= 1
    break if i == 0
  end
end

example('hello')
```
the example method is invoked and passed and argument of the string `'hello'`. The output of the method will be 
```ruby
hello
hello
hello
```
The method will return 'nil'

This demonstrates method definition and invocation. Namely, the method invocation of `example` is passed the string object `'hello'` which is then assigned to the method parameter `str`. Now that `str` references the string object, when `puts` is called and passed `str`, it will output the object `'hello'`. This continues 3 times until the break statements conditional is met.

### 5

```

## Variable Shadowing

### 9

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

a = 4
b = 2

2.times do |a|
  a = 5
  puts a
end

```

### 10

  n = 11
end

puts n
```

### 11

## Object Passing / Variables as Pointers

### 12

**Current time:** 

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

What are `a` and `b`?

```ruby
a = "hi there"
b = a
a = "not here"
```

`a` is initialized and assigned to the string object `"hi there"`

b is initialized and assigned to reference the same object "hi there", and at this point, both a and b point to the same object in memory.

a is then reassigned to the string object `"not here"`, which will break the link between a and the object it previously referenced (`"hi there"`). Now both `a` and `b` point to separate objects in memory, the string `"not here"` and `"hi there"` respectively.

This is a demonstration of variable reassignment and variables as pointers.

### 13

**Current time:** 

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

What are `a` and `b`?

```ruby
a = "hi there"
b = a
a << ", Bob"
```
This problem will not output anything and will return the string "hi there, Bob"
This demonstrates variable reassignment, variables as pointers, and the mutability of objects.
`a` is initialized and assigned the string object with value "hi there" on line 1. `b` is initalized on 
line 2 and assigned to reference the same string object as `a`
we then call the `<<` method to append the string `", Bob"` to `a`. Since `a` and `b` reference the same object as it was mutated

### 14

**Current time:** 

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

What are a, b, and c? What if the last line was `c = a.uniq!`?

```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3, 3]
b = a
c = a.uniq
```

This code demonstates variables as pointers.

On line 1, `a` is initialized to the array `[1, 2, 3, 3]`. On line 2, be is intialized and references the same array object as `a`. 

On line 3, `c` is initialized to the return of the method call of `uniq` on the local variable `a`. Calling `uniq` is non-destructive, and will only set the unique elements of the called collection.

There is not output of the code, but the return after initializing `c` will be `[1, 2, 3]`

### 15

**Current time:** 

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

test(a)
```

end
